# Disability-Friendly Adventure Game

Description

This is a group project that consists of creating an interactive adventure game with many different accessibility features such as text-to-speech, colorblind mode, 
enlarge text, Dark and Light mode, and also add the ability to augment the screen size (maximize and minimize screen). The text-to-speech feature requires the use of a
third-party library/API. Furthermore, the project is produced using Java OOP, follows the S.O.L.I.D principles, and incorporates various design patterns allowing, 
our code to be well-structured, recognizable, efficient, and display GUIs that adhere to UI & UX best practices. Finally, this project was executed in an agile
environment, specifically the Scrum framework. The team participated in daily stand-ups to discuss progress, address challenges, and plan tasks.
